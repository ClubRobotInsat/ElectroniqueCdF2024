# Feedback

This file contains feedback, ideas, and things to do next year for the electronics team, gathered after the 2024 french robotics cup ,  
its purpose is to help the club to improve and guide newcomers with experience-driven suggestions and tips.

- Properly use git, i.e. hosting entire projects on github and pulling/pushing instead of just uploading/downloading zipped project files. [Potential inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn6004q9oeqEwmWBugy04WfmDpkLn4PIn)
- Update club KiCad library
- Establish routines/procedures/checklist(s) for signing off on/ordering PCBs, possibly including use of github actions. [Potential checklist](https://github.com/azonenberg/pcb-checklist)
- Rounded corners on PCBs
- [Use KiCad plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMdX3R9ni7g)
- If reusing/iterating on cards from 2024, everything in the anomaly file must be addressed
- Print PCBs on paper at 1:1 scale to verify footprints and check mechanical compliance.
