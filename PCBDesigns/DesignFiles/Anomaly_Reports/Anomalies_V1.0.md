## Motor Driver V1.0:

- Encoder footprint has too narrow holes
- Better silkscreen options to consider (such as the +12V pin vs GND pins)

## Primary power supply card V1.0:

- Holes on PTN78020W power supply footprint are too narrow. Current solution: replaced pins with smaller ones.
- Battery connector footprint has +Vbatt and GND pins swapped. Current solution: put connector on bottom face of board.
