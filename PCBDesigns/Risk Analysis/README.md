# Risk Analysis 
This risk analysis' sole purpose is to prepare for the competition

## Electronics risks

-Main power supply down => Plan B for powering boards  
-Power supply overvoltage destroying all MCPs => Solution is to buy many MCPs as replacements, zener diodes can be used at MCP pins but I believe it will incur more issues  
-CAN Module wires disconnecting during battle => Total loss of communication, an alternative must urgently be found (PICAN?)
